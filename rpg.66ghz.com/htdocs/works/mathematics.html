work
of all: Deficiency (age: 12/13)<br>



= Discovered
and Proved a method to check divisibility by seven and also get the
resultant remainder without actual division<br>



= General
method of checking divisibility based on deficiency without actual
division<br>



= Digital root<br>



= Digital root
regularities<br>



= Proved
2^(n-1)(2^n &ndash; 1) is an even perfect number if (2^n &ndash; 1) is prime<br>



= Linked that
digital root is remainder of 9<br>



= Developed a
general form of digital root (Later
found out that I had actually discovered congruences)<br>



= Primes and
digital root (some theorems)<br>

fibonacci numbers (many formulas made and proved)<br>

algebra and related stuff with physics<br>



= Proved the
four color theorem (Later
realised that I had actually discovered graph theory, which I had
called connector theory and my solution was imperfect same
as that happened with Kempe, later disproved by Tait) <br>
